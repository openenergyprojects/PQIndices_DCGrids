# PQIndices_DCGrids
Power Quality indicators for DC grids (networks)

There is no actual standard for defining PQ in DC networks, besides some normatives from Military applications and Telecom Networks. 
Therefore, this was was one of the first attempts in defing such indicators that could play a role in the design of a DC grid (microgrid), inlcuding the stability analyis of the controllers. 

All indices were defined based on non-stationary signal processing analyis for both time and frequency domains.

# Notes:
All definitions and rationale for their choice can be found in the paper "Analytical derivation of PQ indicators compatible with control strategies for DC microgrids", published at IEEE PowerTEch Conference, Manchester, UK 2017.

#HOW TO USE:
The mat files in the current folder are either simulated signals or lab aquired signals from an experimnetal setup presented in the paper. 
The simulink files that were used to generate both lab tests signal and the simulated signals are part of Project: SimplifiedDCMicrogridModel.
